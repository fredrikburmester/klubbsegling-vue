*/\n\nexport const BREAK = Object.freeze({});\n/**\n * visit() will walk through an AST using a depth-first traversal, calling\n * the visitor's enter function at each node in the traversal, and calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *   enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *     // @return\n *     //   undefined: no action\n *     //   false: skip visiting this node\n *     //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *     //   null: delete this node\n *     //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n *   },\n *   leave(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *     // @return\n *     //   undefined: no action\n *     //   false: no action\n *     //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *     //   null: delete this node\n *     //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively to providing enter() and leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to three permutations of the\n * visitor API:\n *\n * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node of a specific kind.\n *\n * ```ts\n * visit(ast, {\n *   Kind(node) {\n *     // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of a specific kind.\n *\n * ```ts\n * visit(ast, {\n *   Kind: {\n *     enter(node) {\n *       // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *     }\n *     leave(node) {\n *       // leave the \"Kind\" node\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.\n *\n * ```ts\n * visit(ast, {\n *   enter(node) {\n *     // enter any node\n *   },\n *   leave(node) {\n *     //
